# PES_PROJECT_2_FRDM
WE MAKE AN EMPTY PROJECT AND ADD ALL THE NECESSARY BOARD FILES FROM A NEW COMPLETELY CREATED PROJECT. THEN WE ADD THE VARIABLES, ESSENTIALLY THE FLAGS WE WILL BE  USING TO GENERATE AN ECECUTABLE VERSION OF THE C SOURCE. THEN WE DEFINE BUILD TARGETS FOR PC, IN ITS RUN AND DEBUG MODE, AND FOR ARM RUN AND DEBUG MODE. WE WRITE THE DIFFERENT VARIABLES FOR COMPILATION OF C SOURCE FILE IN ARM EXECUTABLE FILE AND PC EXECUTABLE VERSION
